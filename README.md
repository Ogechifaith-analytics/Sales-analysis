# OVERVIEW
Hello, I'm Ogechi Faith, a Data Analyst passionate about turning data into actionable insights.
With a strong foundation in SQL and Excel, I specialize in analyzing complex datasets to uncover strategic insights that empower data-driven decision-making. I thrive both independently and in collaborative environments, applying my analytical skills to solve real-world problems.
This repository showcases a project where I utilized SQL and Excel to analyze sales data and build interactive dashboard for various modes of transportation across 21 countries. Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to handle large datasets, identify key trends, and present findings that inform business strategies.
